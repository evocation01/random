    "  I had previously applied to this aid, and was accepted. However,  I was not able to finish the course, due to the major earthquake that I was also within the city that got affected the most, which happened about 1 month after I started the course. Until then, I was studying the course regularly. However, due to earthquake, I was already falling behind on my university lectures and had to give my best on them, so couldn't continue this course. In the last month, I finished the 1/3 of the course and will definitely work hard on it from now on.\n",

And in order to do this, it's almost crucial to learn Python, according to any data on this subject. And this course is the best way to do it in my opinion.\n",
    "   The main reason for me applying to this financial aid is actually due to my country's financial situation. As you might already know, Turkey's financial system is not very great, to say at least. Our currency, Turkish Lira suffered from about a 50-60% downfall and we have over 80% inflation, formally at least. Actually, in real life, the inflation is definitely over 200%.\n",

For instance, this course costs about 300 dollars, equivalent of about 8000 turkish liras. This equals to about 1/3 of my annual income, which I just cannot pay, for the foreseeable future.\n",
    "   At the date of me writing this, 12th of July, Turkish Lira had 30% downfall against major foreign currencies, just in the last 3 weeks. So, I'm afraid things have not been going for better within last 6 months.\n",

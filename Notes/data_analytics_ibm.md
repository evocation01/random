"Businesses today recognize the untapped value in data and data analytics as a crucial factor for business competitiveness. To drive their data and analytics initiatives, companies are hiring and Upskilling people. They are expanding their teams and creating centers of excellence to set up a multi-pronged data and analytics practice in their organizations." 
- The Power of Data to Transform Your Business (a Forrester Report)

Forbes 2020 Report:
"The constant increase in data processing speeds and bandwidth, the nonstop invention of new tools for creating, sharing and consuming data, and the steady addition of new data creators and consumers around the world, ensure that data growth continues unabated. Data begets more data in a constant virtuous cycle."

		analyzes past events to estimate the likelihood of different outcomes
		
	PROCESS:
		1- understanding the problem, desired outcome
		2- setting a clear metric, what and how should it be measured.
		3- gathering data, identify data you req, best tools, best sources for data
		4- cleaning data: fixing quality issues in data, standardize data coming from multiple sources.
		5- Analyzing and Mining data:
			extract, analyze, manipulate data from different perspectives to understand trends, find patterns
		6- Interpreting results:
			evaluating defendability of analysis 
		7- Presenting your findings:
			communicate, present.
			
		understand problem, wanted outcome.

WHAT IS DATA ANALYTICS:

- Collecting, analyzing data/info
- Confirm Hypo
- Storytelling with Data

- Use of info to make decisions

- Define the problem, create hypothesis, collect/clean data to test, analyze data, present.

- analyze sets of data to understand what's going on.

- understand where a business is coming from, it's present and predict its future decisions

- Analyze, present, share data. To communicate business insights, help make better decisions.

- Process of gathering info from relevant population. Breaking that info into subsets (cluster probability), using that data to make decisions, predictions.

# State differences between data analytics and data analysis, in the POV of statistics.
Data Analytics vs. Data Analysis:
	they are often used interchangeably.
	however there is a subtle diff.
	
	Analysis - detailed exam of the elements or structure of sth
	Analytics - the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics
		* for data and statistics POV, they are about same thing.
		
		
RESPONSIBILITIES:
	acquiring data
	creating quaries to extract data
	filtering, cleaning, standarzing, reorganizing data

* Overview of Data Repo's:
- databases, data warehouses, Big Data stores
	Database:
		collection of data for input, storage, search, retrieval and modification of data
	DBMS: (Database Management System) 
		a set of programs for creating and maintaining the db, and storing, modifying and extracting info from the db.
		* uses "Querying" function.
		
		- Factors like,
		Data type, 
		data structure, 
		querying mechanisms, 
		latency req's, 
		transaction speeds, 
		intended use
			- governs the choice of database.
			
	RDBMS: (Relational DBs)
	- data is organized
	- tabular format, rows & columns
	- well-defined structure
	- optimized for data operations and querying
	* Standard tool: SQL 
		
	NoSQL: (Non-Relational Databases)
	* "Not Only SQL"
	- emerged in response,
		to the Volume, speed and diversity of data generation
			i.e. Cloud Computing, IoT, social media.
	- build for speed, flex, scale:
		schema-less form of data.
	- Big Data Processing.
	
Data Warehouse:
	- works as a central repo
		that merges info coming from a disperate sources and consolidates it through the extract, transform and load (ETL) process. 
			into one comprehensive db for analytics and BI.
	- Although historically it was only using RDBMS, due to technical breakthroughs, both NoSQL and RDBMS (SQL) repo's are now used in Data Warehouses.
	
	Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Process:
		- Extract Data 
			from different sources
		- transform data
			to clean, usable state.
		- Load Data
			into the data repo.
	
Big Data Stores:
	* Distributed computational and storage infrastructure to store, scale and process very large datasets.

SUMMARY:
* Data repo's help to isolate data,
	* and make reporting and analytics more efficient and credible
		* while also serving as a data archive.


RDBMS:
	rows -> records
	columns - > attributes

	- based on flat files i.e. spreadsheets
	- ideal for optimized storage, retrieval, processing for LARGE volumes of data
	- relationships between tables
	- restrictions can be made
	* SQL / can retrieve millions of records in seconds
	
	* IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle Database, PostgreSQL
	* Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, IBM DB2 Cloud, Oracle Cloud, SQL Azure 
	
	- creating meaningful info
	- flexibility
	- minimize data redundancy 
	- easy backup/recovery
	- ACID complient!
	
	* ACID: 
		Atomicity
		Consistency
		Isolation
		Durability
		
* Suitable For:
	- OLTP application 
	(Online Transaction Processing)
	- Data Warehouses
	-IoT solutions
	
*Limitations
	- works well for structured data only
	- merging is difficult
	- greater val than defined gets lost
	
NoSQL DB:
	not only SQL 
	non SQL
	
	- scale, performance, ease of use
	- built for specific data models
	- not traditional row/column/table designed
	- schema-less / free-form storing
	
	* Key-val store:
		key:attribute
		no relationships
		no multiple keys
		
		- Redis, Memcached, DynamoDB
	* Documnet-based:
		+ flexible indexing
		+ powerful ad hoc queries
		+ analytics over docs
		- complex queries
		- multi-op transactions
		: MongoDB, CouchDB, Cloudant, DocumentDB
	* Column-based:
		+ column family (groping of columns)
		+ easier, faster accessing/searches
		+ great for heavy write/read requests 
		- running complex queries
		- change patterns frequently
		: cassandra, hbase
		
	* Graph-based
		+ visualizing, interpreting, relationdships
		+ social networks, network diagrams, product recommendations, access management (face unlock etc.)
		+ neo4j, cosmosDB
		
+ ability to handle LARGE VOLS of data
+ distributed system
+ effective, efficient


RDBMS : NOSQL
typed/composed : schema-less
expensive : low-cost
ACID-compliance : not 
mature, easy troubleshoot : new, can be tricky


* Data Marts, Data Lakes, ETL, Data Pipelines:
	- Data Warehouse:
		multi-purpose storage
		data has already gone through ETL process, ready to analysis/mining
	
	- Data Marts:
		a specific DWH.
		built for some purpose
		* giving stakeholders the relevant data, when they need it.
		restricted, isolation, security
	
	- Data Lakes:
		storage repo
		any RAW data
		classified, tagged as metadata
		* "STAGING AREA" of a DWH.
		predictive, advanced analysis
	
	
	- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process:
		gather raw data
		extract relevant info
		clean, standardize, transform
		load into a data-repo
		
	- Extract: 
		raw data -> staging area
		
		Batch Processing:
			move large data, at scheduled intervals
			* Blendo, Stitch
		Stream Processing:
			pull real-time data, transform mid-transit
			* Apache Samza, Storm and Kafka
			
	- Transform
		standardize (km, dd/mm/yy...)
		remove NA, duplicates
		filter()
		enrich data (i.e. name A B = A, B)
		key-relationships
		data validations, rules
		
		* Initial Loading:
			all data into repo
		* Incremental Loading:
			periodically update/modify
		* Full-refresh:
			erase, reload data
		
* Data Pipeline:
	- the whole journey of moving data
	- includes ETL
	- batch, stream data
	* Apache Beam and Kafka, DataFlow
	

Foundations of Big Data:
	- Ernst and Young:
		* big data refers to the dynamic, large, and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools, and machines. It requires new, innovative and scalable technology to collect, host, and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered in order to drive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management, and enhanced shareholder value.
		
		- 5V's:
		Velocity : extremely fast, never stops
		Volume : scale
		Variety : SQL, NoSQL, schema-less
		Veracity : quality, origin, consistency, completeness, integrity, ambiguity
		Value : profit, benefits, satisfaction

* Apache Hadoop, Hive, Spark.
	- Hadoop: 
		distributed storage and processing of BD
		Java-based
		Node : a computer
		Cluster : >1 computer
		
		reliable, scalable, cost-effective
		
	- Hive:
		DWH
		- high latency
		+ ETL, data analysis
		+ SQL
		
	- Spark:
		distributed data analytics framework 
		Analysis, Processing, ML, Data Integration, ETL
		
* OLTP: Online Transaction Processing

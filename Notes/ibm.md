### DEVOPS
- Development and (IT) Ops

* Benefits:
    - Velocity
    - Quality 

* The Pipeline of Application Delivery:

- Idea 
- Code : </>
- Build : unit test cases, packaging into .exe 
- Deploy : runtime env (baremetal, virtualenv, cloud)
- Manage : dev, test, pre-prod
- Learn : continuous improvement (CI)

* Use Cases:
    - Optimize Core
    (monolithic, legacy, big systems)
        difficult to modernise, so we have to optimize it as best as we could

    - Unlock Legacy
        addressing culture, ways of working, bringing dev & ops together

    - Unleashing Digital
        CI -> CD
        going back to Idea
        (feedback into the pipeline)

- automation
- test first & automate

# harsh realities?
- managing cloud infrastructure
- servers, db, networks, security
- terraforms, CI/CD pipelines, automation scripts
- very stay-up-to-date
- constantly learn new things
- huge, high evolutionary rate
- unrealistic expectations
+ there is always things to do
- strong communication
- fight your own case, prove that it is an importan thing to do
(i.e. doing a 20hr automation task that only take 20 mins ir)
- unpredictability, unstructuredness
+ pay is great xD
- really high responsibility - entire software dev lifecycle, from planning to deployment (CI to CD!)
